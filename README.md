# Just-Java
A Java based Android Application - Apps for selling coffee!

This app allow users to pretend (literally) that they want to order cup(s) of coffee.
Users can input Their names, what toppings, and how many cups that they want. And the app will give the order summary to users.

Its my practice project when enroll [Android Basic Nanodegree by Udacity (free version)](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)


I'm not author of this project and also not fully written by me (Sometimes, I'm copy some code from [Udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/ud839_Miwok) or search some solution (then modify it to fit with my problem) when I'm getting very confused about with the teacher's explanation)

Do with them what you want (please use it wisely) and feel free to send updates or improvements or ideas.
Also, if you are getting confused with certain code, please don't hesitate to contact me.
